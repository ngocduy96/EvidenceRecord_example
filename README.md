###EvidenceRecord Example

This repository is a learning project designed to explore the concepts and standards outlined in RFC 6283 (An Evidence Record Syntax for Long-Term Non-Repudiation) and RFC 4998 (Evidence Record Syntax). The main goal of this project is to understand how evidence records can be used to ensure long-term data integrity and non-repudiation.

##Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
	•	Study the theoretical foundations of evidence records as defined in RFC 6283 and RFC 4998.
	•	Build a practical example of how to generate and validate evidence records.
	•	Provide a hands-on learning experience for understanding the principles of long-term data security.

##Features
	•	HashTree Construction: Demonstrates the process of building and reducing a HashTree.
	•	Evidence Record Creation: Example implementation of generating evidence records based on a HashTree.
	•	Learning-Oriented: The project is not intended for production use but rather as a foundation for further exploration of long-term data integrity.

##Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only. It is intended to aid in understanding the standards and concepts described in the RFCs. The code provided here should not be used in production systems.
